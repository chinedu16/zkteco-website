              IoT products. Adapting to the needs of the market, in the last
              year ZKTeco incorporated body temperature measurement into its
              offer in its TD (temperature detection) and TI (thermal images)
              product line. The founders of ZKTeco Co., Limited (ZKTeco) since
              1998 have strived for independent research and development of
              biometric verification algorithms and production of the SDK, which
              was initially widely applied in the fields of computer security
              and identity authentication . With continuous improvement in
              development and a host of market applications, we have gradually
              built a smart security and identity authentication ecosystem based
              on biometric verification techniques. With years of experience,
              ZKTeco was officially established in 2007 and is one of the
              world's leading biometric verification companies. With
              Headquarters established in Dongguan, and factory in Xiamen,
              ZKTeco strives to integrate its in-house developed hybrid
              biometric verification technology with the Internet of Things
              (IoT) and applies this technology to smart office, smart
              financing, smart traffic and smart security solutions.
